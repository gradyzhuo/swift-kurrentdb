## 🧭 Project Heritage & Design Philosophy

Knowing where the public API comes from — and where it deliberately steps away from precedent — helps when reviewing PRs and proposing new surface. This is the context maintainers use when evaluating design questions.

### Built on

- [grpc-swift](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-swift) — Swift gRPC implementation (v2.x)
- [swift-nio](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio) — Non-blocking I/O
- [swift-log](https://github.com/apple/swift-log) — Logging API

### Design influences and divergences

The shape of the public API and the underlying wire semantics owe a lot to the official Kurrent/EventStoreDB clients — primarily the [.NET](https://github.com/EventStore/EventStore-Client-Dotnet), [Java](https://github.com/EventStore/EventStoreDB-Client-Java), and [Node.js](https://github.com/EventStore/EventStoreDB-Client-NodeJS) clients. What was adopted, and where this client deliberately takes a different path:

**Adopted from the official clients**
- The `esdb://` connection string format, cluster gossip discovery, and `NodePreference` semantics (leader / follower / random) for routing.
- Optimistic concurrency via expected revision (`.any` / `.noStream` / `.streamExists` / `.at(n)`) and the resulting `wrongExpectedVersion` error path.
- Persistent subscription ACK/NACK with park/retry/skip/stop semantics.
- Subscription filtering primitives (event-type / stream-name prefix and regex).

**Where swift-kurrentdb diverges**
- **Target-based API instead of flat methods.** Official clients expose a flat surface like `client.appendToStream(name, options, events)`. swift-kurrentdb scopes operations through typed targets — `client.streams(of: .specified("orders")).append(...)`, `client.projections(name: ...)`, `client.persistentSubscriptions(stream: ..., group: ...)` — so the compiler rules out illegal operations (e.g. tombstoning `$all`) before they reach the wire.
- **Trailing-closure builders for options** instead of options objects/records. This keeps the call site terse and removes the need for either parameter overloads or partially-filled structs.
- **Actor-based client with Swift 6 strict concurrency.** `KurrentDBClient` and `NodeSelector` are actors, not thread-safe instances guarded by locks. The whole package compiles under `-strict-concurrency=complete` with zero `@unchecked Sendable`.
- **Typed throws.** Operations throw `KurrentError` rather than a hierarchy of untyped exceptions, so callers exhaustively handle failure cases at compile time.
- **Three-layer module split** (`KurrentDB` → `GRPCEncapsulates` → `Generated`). gRPC patterns (`UnaryUnary`, `UnaryStream`, etc.) live in their own module so the public API stays decoupled from generated protobuf types — the same pattern can be reused by other gRPC-backed Swift clients without dragging KurrentDB-specific types along.

When in doubt about a proposed design, lean toward these principles. If a new surface fights them, that's a signal to discuss the design in an issue before opening a PR.

## 📝 Coding Guidelines

### Swift Style

We follow the [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/) and [Swift.org formatting guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/articles/formatting.html).

**Key Points:**

1. **Naming**
   ```swift
   // ✅ Good: Clear, descriptive names
   func appendToStream(_ streamName: String, events: [EventData]) async throws
   
   // ❌ Bad: Unclear abbreviations
   func append(_ s: String, evts: [EventData]) async throws
   ```

2. **Documentation**
   ```swift
   /// Appends events to a stream with optimistic concurrency control.
   ///
   /// - Parameters:
   ///   - streamName: The name of the stream to append to
   ///   - events: The events to append
   /// - Throws: `KurrentError` if the operation fails
   /// - Returns: The write result including the next expected revision
   public func appendToStream(
       _ streamName: String,
       events: [EventData]
   ) async throws -> WriteResult
   ```

3. **Error Handling**
   ```swift
   // ✅ Good: Specific error types
   enum KurrentError: Error {
       case connectionFailed(reason: String)
       case wrongExpectedRevision(expected: StreamRevision, actual: StreamRevision)
   }
   
   // ❌ Bad: Generic errors
   throw NSError(domain: "error", code: 1)
   ```

4. **Async/Await**
   ```swift
   // ✅ Good: Use async/await
   func readStream(_ streamName: String) async throws -> AsyncThrowingStream<Event, Error>
   
   // ❌ Bad: Completion handlers (unless necessary for compatibility)
   func readStream(_ streamName: String, completion: @escaping (Result<[Event], Error>) -> Void)
   ```

5. **Access Control**
   ```swift
   // Use appropriate access levels
   public class KurrentDBClient { }      // Public API
   internal struct StreamMetadata { }    // Internal implementation
   private func validateStream() { }     // Private helpers
   ```

### Code Organization

- One type per file (generally)
- Group related functionality
- Use extensions for protocol conformance
- Keep functions focused and small

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

1. **Test Coverage**
   - Aim for high test coverage on critical paths
   - Test both success and failure cases
   - Include edge cases

2. **Test Structure**
   ```swift
   final class StreamOperationsTests: XCTestCase {
       var client: KurrentDBClient!
       
       override func setUp() async throws {
           client = KurrentDBClient(settings: .localhost())
       }
       
       func testAppendToStream() async throws {
           // Given
           let streamName = "test-\(UUID())"
           let event = EventData(eventType: "TestEvent", model: ["key": "value"])
           
           // When
           let result = try await client.appendStream(streamName, events: [event])
           
           // Then
           XCTAssertEqual(result.nextExpectedRevision, .specific(1))
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Integration Tests**
   - Test against real Kurrent instance (in Docker)
   - Use unique stream names (with UUIDs)
   - Clean up resources

4. **Test Naming**
   ```swift
   // Format: test[What]_[Condition]_[ExpectedResult]
   func testAppendToStream_WithValidEvent_ReturnsWriteResult() async throws { }
   func testAppendToStream_WithWrongRevision_ThrowsError() async throws { }
   ```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
swift test

# Run specific test
swift test --filter KurrentDBTests.StreamOperationsTests

# Run with coverage
swift test --enable-code-coverage
```

## 📚 Documentation Guidelines

### DocC Documentation

1. **Document all public APIs**
   ```swift
   /// A client for interacting with Kurrent.
   ///
   /// Use `KurrentDBClient` to perform operations on event streams,
   /// manage subscriptions, and work with projections.
   ///
   /// ## Topics
   ///
   /// ### Creating a Client
   /// - ``init(settings:)``
   ///
   /// ### Stream Operations
   /// - ``appendStream(_:events:options:)``
   /// - ``readStream(_:options:)``
   public class KurrentDBClient { }
   ```

2. **Include Examples**
   ```swift
   /// Appends events to a stream.
   ///
   /// ```swift
   /// let event = EventData(eventType: "OrderPlaced", model: order)
   /// try await client.appendStream("orders", events: [event])
   /// ```
   ```

3. **Articles and Tutorials**
   - Add tutorials to `Documentation/KurrentDB.docc/`
   - Use clear, step-by-step instructions
   - Include complete, working examples

### README and Guides

- Keep the README concise and focused
- Link to detailed documentation
- Update examples when APIs change
